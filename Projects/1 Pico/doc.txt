Pico is an interactive desk companion built with an ESP32-C3 and a 1.3 inch SH1106 OLED display. It responds to touch gestures with smooth animations, sound feedback, and contextual messages, creating a playful yet functional user experience. The device also includes a built-in Pomodoro timer with visual and audio cues to support focused work and break sessions. This project explores embedded UI design, touch-based interaction, and real-time state management on resource-constrained hardware.
