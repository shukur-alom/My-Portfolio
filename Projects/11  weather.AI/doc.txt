first the IoT device sends data to the central server then the central server sends data to the computer
and mobile app. The computer predicts data by artificial intelligence and sends data to the central
server and sends predicted data to the mobile app using the central server. At the same time, our
website was updated with predicted data. Here I used the MQTT protocol. for prediction, I used linear
regression algorithm and python.
IoT Device : For IoT, I used ESP32. Sensors I used MQ-2, MQ-7, Mq135 and DHT 22. At first, I stored
Data in CSV format and then train our intelligence model to predict future data.
