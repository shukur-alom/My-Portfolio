CardioCare-AI is an innovative solution designed to monitor and analyze heart rate and oxygen levels (O3) using a combination of an IoT device and an advanced AI module. The system comprises three main components: a mobile application, an IoT device, and an AI module, each playing a crucial role in delivering comprehensive health monitoring and analysis.

The IoT device is equipped with real-time sensors that measure heart rate and oxygen levels. This data is then transmitted to the mobile application, where users can view their health metrics in an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The mobile app not only displays real-time data but also connects to the AI module for advanced analysis.

The AI module processes the data collected by the IoT device, providing predictive insights and alerts based on the user's health metrics. This advanced analysis helps in identifying potential health issues before they become critical, enabling proactive healthcare management.

Additionally, the mobile app offers a feature for users to connect with a doctor for further consultation. This ensures that users have access to professional medical advice whenever needed, enhancing the overall healthcare experience.

CardioCare-AI is currently in its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage, focusing on delivering essential features and gathering user feedback for future enhancements. The project aims to integrate more health monitoring sensors, improve AI algorithms for better predictive insights, and expand mobile app features to provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience.

CardioCare-AI represents a significant step forward in personal health monitoring, combining cutting-edge technology with user-centric design to deliver a powerful tool for managing heart health.
