Leaf Disease Detection System
Oct 2021 - Oct 2021Oct 2021 - Oct 2021
Leaf Disease Detection System is an AI-powered plant health analysis project designed to identify and assess leaf diseases from images in real time. The system combines computer vision with large vision-language models to detect diseases, classify their severity, and provide clear treatment recommendations. It uses a FastAPI backend for scalable API access and a Streamlit-based web interface for an intuitive user experience. By integrating Meta’s Llama Vision models through the Groq API, the application delivers structured results including disease type, confidence score, visible symptoms, and suggested actions. The project focuses on practical use in agriculture, aiming to make early disease detection faster, more accurate, and accessible for farmers, researchers, and agri-tech platforms.
